        <h1>Services</h1>
        <h2>Historic Building Recording</h2>
        <p>A client with an historic property or old property may wish to make alterations and be asked by the local planning authority to produce a document recording its architecture and history as it stands today before alteration.  This document is an Historic Building Record and contains written text, photographs and plans and would be produced to one of four Levels following English Heritage guidance.  A full recording service is offered by the Consultancy to suit the clientâ€™s requirements.</p>

        <h2>Conservation Planning</h2>
        <p>When proposing alterations to a heritage asset the Consultancy produces Conservation Statements to assist the client in the delivery of the scheme whilst caring for the historical significance of the asset.  Conservation Area Assessments are also undertaken by the Consultancy.  Other services offered which are aligned to development proposals are Statements of Significance, Historic Building Assessments and Impact Assessments.</p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>Specific research can be undertaken for clients on any matter concerning the historic built environment.  This may be as support research for a university or co-authorship of papers; research of historic buildings in the property portfolio of large estates or any research required by an individual.  A current research project by the Consultancy is looking at the implications of moving historic buildings and the effects of climate change.</p>
